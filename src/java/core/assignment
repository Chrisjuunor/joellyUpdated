Scenario: You are developing an API for an online gambling platform that offers 
various games of chance. As part of your development tasks, you need to design and
 implement several API endpoints to handle different aspects of the gambling 
experience.

Question: Design the API endpoints for the following features of the online gambling
 platform:
1. User Registration: Create an API endpoint that allows users to register an account.
The endpoint should receive parameters such as name (string), email (string), password
(string), and age (integer). The API should validate the inputs, perform age 
verification, and create a new user account if the provided information is valid.

2. Game Selection: Create an API endpoint that lists the available games on the 
platform. The API should return information about each game, including its name, 
description, and betting options.

3. Game Betting: Create an API endpoint that allows users to place bets on a selected
 game. The endpoint should receive parameters such as user_id (integer), 
game_id (integer), bet_amount (float), and bet_options (array). 
The API should validate the inputs, verify the user's balance, process the bet, 
and return the outcome of the bet.

4. Account Balance: Create an API endpoint that retrieves the account balance for a 
given user. The endpoint should receive the user_id as a parameter and return the 
current balance.

5. Transaction History: Create an API endpoint that fetches the transaction history
 for a user. The endpoint should receive the user_id as a parameter and return a list
 of transactions, including details like the transaction type (deposit or withdrawal),
 amount, and timestamp.

Please outline the request format, response format, and any error scenarios that should be handled for each of the mentioned endpoints. Additionally, consider any authentication or security measures
that should be implemented to protect user data and ensure fair gambling practices.

Note: Feel free to include any additional details or constraints that you think 
would be relevant to this scenario.
